--------------

Keiiti Aki 和 Paul G. Richards 编写的经典地震学教材
《Quantitative Seismology: Theory and Methods》对地震学的定义如下：

  **Seismology is a science based on data called seismograms,
  which are records of mechanical vibrations of the Earth.
  These vibrations may be caused artificially by man-made explosions,
  or they may be caused naturally by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.**
